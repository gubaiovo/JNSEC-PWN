## üîß Adding/Modifying Challenges?

### ü§î Is the Challenge Suitable for Inclusion?

Don‚Äôt rush. Before submitting a challenge, consider the following questions:

- **Is your challenge folder complete? ‚Äî At the very least, it should include doc.json, attachments, and a working exp.**
- *Does a similar challenge already exist, or is the content nearly identical with only the hints changed?*
- *Is your challenge ready for the Beta stage? If it‚Äôs unsolvable or has unintended solutions, please refine it as much as possible.*
- **Does your challenge involve copyright issues? Do not add challenges that are not permitted to be shared.**

### ‚úíÔ∏è Ensure Challenge Information Is Accurate

Based on the [README](https://readme.md/), please try to complete your doc.json as thoroughly as possible to avoid misunderstandings.

### üîÇ One PR, One Task

- When adding a challenge, ensure each PR includes only one challenge. The PR title should indicate the challenge being added, e.g., `[Base][PIE] challenge addition`.
- When modifying a challenge, ensure each PR includes only one modified challenge. The PR title should indicate the challenge being modified, e.g., `[Base][PIE] challenge modification`.
- When deleting a plugin, ensure each PR includes only one deleted challenge. The PR title should indicate the challenge being deleted, e.g., `[Base][PIE] challenge deletion`.

### ‚è≥ Be Patient After Submitting a PR

After submitting a PR, maintainers will review your challenge as soon as possible. They will provide feedback based on automated checks, this guide, and their judgment. If they cannot make a decision, your PR may be escalated to higher-level maintainers. During this process, you may choose whether to adopt their suggestions (if any). These suggestions may help your challenge integrate more smoothly into the challenge repository.
